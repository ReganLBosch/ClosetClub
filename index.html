		<h4>
			Send Us Your<br />
			Stuff To Store
		</h4>
		<p>
			Sign-up for a Closet Club account, and<br />
			receive your welcome kit with everything<br />
			you need to get started,  including our<br />
			patented location tracking hangers and<br />
			protective containers.
		</P>
		<p>
			Then just schedule a pick-up, and we will<br />
			do the rest. Unlike traditional storage<br />
			models, we track each item individually<br />
			so that nothing gets stored and forgotten<br />
			about. Because if you didn't care about<br />
			what was in storage, you wouldn't bother<br />
			storing it! 
		</p>

		<h4>
			Your Closet,<br />
			In The Cloud
		</h4>
		<p>
			We photograph each item you send and<br />
			add it to your virtual closet so that you<br />
			can keep track of what's there. 
		</p>

		<p>	
			Save outfits, group items by type or<br />
			season, or even pack your suitcase from<br />
			your phone. You can photograph and<br />
			upload all of your items at home too, for<br />
			a complete virtual closet experience. It's<br />
			like the giant closet you always dreamed<br />
			of, without building an addition on your<br />
			house.

		<h3>

		<h4>
			Get Anything<br />
			Back, Anytime
		</h4>
		<p>
			Call back one item at a time, a custom<br />
			group of items, or all of it at once. Maybe<br />
			you have a date and need your lucky<br />
			outfit, or you're going on a camping trip<br />
			and need your sleeping bag, Or your date<br />
			IS a camping trip, whatever.
		</p>
		<p>
			Simply select the items in your virtual<br />
			closet and pick a delivery date. We can<br />
			even bring your items that same day if<br />
			you need us to.
		</p>
		<p>
			And with Concierge services, your stuff<br />
			comes back in better condition than you<br />
			sent it.
