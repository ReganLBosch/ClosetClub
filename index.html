				Stuff To Store
				</h4>
				<p> Sign-up for a Closet Club account, and receive your welcome kit with everything you need to get started,  including our patented location tracking hangers and protective containers.
				</P>
				<p> Then just schedule a pick-up, and we will do the rest. Unlike traditional storage models, we track each item individually so that nothing gets stored and forgotten about. Because if you didn't care about what was in storage, you wouldn't bother storing it!

				<h4><firstletter>2.</firstletter>Your Closet,<br />In The Cloud
				</h4>
				<p>We photograph each item you send and add it to your virtual closet so that you can keep track of what's there. 
				</p>
				<p>Save outfits, group items by type or season, or even pack your suitcase from your phone. You can photograph and upload all of your items at home too, for a complete virtual closet experience. It's like the giant closet you always dreamed of, without building an addition on your house.

			<div class="steps">
<!-- 				<h3> 
					3.
				</h3> -->
				<h4><firstletter>3.</firstletter>Get Anything<br />Back, Anytime
				</h4>
				<p>Call back one item at a time, a custom group of items, or all of it at once. Maybe you have a date and need your lucky outfit, or you're going on a camping trip and need your sleeping bag, Or your date IS a camping trip, whatever.
				</p>
				<p>Simply select the items in your virtual closet and pick a delivery date. We can even bring your items that same day if you need us to.
				</p>
				<p>And with Concierge services, your stuff comes back in better condition than you sent it.
